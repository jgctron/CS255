This is the portfolio created for CS-255 course at SNHU. This repository has other projects created by me reflecting the system analysis and design skills. Below is an instruction that describes the task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.Paraphrase: Reflections on the work including the business requirements and the system design document created the system for the DriverPass project.

## Project One: Business Requirements Document

### Problem Statement

 DriverPass is an information system that facilitates the process of assuming driving lessons, taking online tests and viewing test results. The company, DriverPass, specializes in driver education and requested this system to be able to be more organised in its scheduling and to provide an online environment for test-taking and viewing results.

### Approach

 So to work on this, I collected and analysed the client’s need and documented it using business requirements document which includes functions that a system must successfully perform in order to satisfy the user’s requirements specified in support of a proposed project or other endeavour.
These functions are grouped into two;
⁃ Student and school admin scheme
⁃ Lesson-taker scheme
A brief description of each function is given below:
1.  User should be able to register on the system
2.  Registered user should be able to log on
3.  User should be able to request for a lesson which has to be approved by the school.
4.  User should be able to modify the particular lesson once it’s approved.
5.  User should be able to cancel a lesson that has been approved.
6.  Once a lesson has been approved, the lesson-taker should be able to take an online test.
7.  Lesson-taker should be able to view his/her test results.

### Overcoming Roadblocks

 A challenge for me was breaking down all the user requirements and translating them into something concrete in the form of functional requirements. Stakeholder interviews turned out to be the key. Use case diagrams were a bonus.

### Expanded Approach to Software Design

 The focus on user-centric design here changed my approach towards software design. By designing for the user, I started to incorporate their needs into the build process and incorporate feedback in the design, rather than having a more formal approach to design.

### Evolution in Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code

 With this project I learnt how to write better, more precise requirements documents, which is extremely important because a well-structured requirements document makes sure that the system can be built by the development team in a way that is more aligned with our wants. 

## Project Two: System Design Document

### Problem Statement

 This document describes the technical specifications and system design of DriverPass to meet the bussiness requirements defined in Project One. The design consists of the Use case diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams and class diagrams. 

### Approach

 UML diagrams showing the functionalities and interactions of the systemI then went on to describe the system in detail in the form of a few UML diagrams: one for the user login, another for the step-by-step process of scheduling driving lessons, another for the online test the users could take after each lesson, and others for the administration aspects (live view on admin tools to enable the admin to view and interact with the users sessions and manage user accounts, and generate custom reports).

### Overcoming Roadblocks

 A substantial investment was needed to make sure the diagrams reflected the system’s flow and relationships. I kept iterating the diagrams, consulting feedback and new analysis towards achieving accuracy and completeness.

### Expanded Approach to Software Design

 This project also drove home the necessity of illustrating system interactions via UML diagrams, and has also made me much better at using such diagrams to communicate complex system designs. 

### Evolution in Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code

 Through it, I have learnt to build system designs that are not only operable but also maintainable and scalable. I therefore focussed on building designs that were modular in composition and readily extendable or adaptable according to the context.
